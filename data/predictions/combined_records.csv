adhd,3316,Treating Anxiety Disorders in Children and Adolescents,"Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders found in Canadian children, with an estimated prevalence rate of 6.4 percent (Stats Canada 2009). Anxiety impairs daily functioning and hinders the overall development of children and youth. From excessive shyness and reassurance seeking, to panic attacks, school phobia, test anxiety, obsessive or compulsive behavior, anxiety can manifest itself in a myriad of ways. These symptoms impact children at home and school, while putting palpable strain the adults trying to help. The research is clear: much of what parents and other adults do to decrease the anxiety actually strengthens it by unintentionally reinforcing avoidance and rigidity. This workshop teaches seven concrete strategies that address anxiety’s quest for certainty and comfort. The strategies give teachers, counselors, school nurses, child care providers and youth workers a plan that guides children and parents out of common but powerful patterns of anxiety, and moves them toward greater autonomy, confidence and resilience. - See more at: http://www.jackhirose.com/workshop/treating-anxiety-disorders-160414-victoria/#sthash.MZcjA8bJ.dpuf",['RoBERTa']
